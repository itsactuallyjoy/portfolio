    <h1>My Journey into Tech </h1>
    <p><em>Published: August 2025</em></p>

    <p>
      My journey into tech started with simple curiosity—wondering how the websites 
      I visited every day were built. I had no background in programming, but I was 
      eager to learn and experiment.
    </p>

    <p>
      My first steps were small: learning <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. 
      At first, the syntax felt strange, but soon I realized I was literally creating 
      something from scratch. That thrill of seeing my first “Hello, World” page pushed me forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, I moved into <strong>JavaScript</strong>, which made my projects 
      interactive. From there, I discovered <strong>Python</strong> and 
      <strong>Django</strong>, which opened my eyes to the world of backend development 
      and data analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking back, I see that persistence, curiosity, and community support have been 
      the biggest drivers in my journey. Every challenge became a stepping stone. 
      Today, I continue to grow—building projects, exploring AI, and aiming to make 
      technology that solves real-world problems.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Lesson learned:</strong> You don’t need to know everything to start. 
    Just begin, stay consistent, and growth will follow. </p>
